# automatic-v2
The unofficial version 2 of backpack.tf automatic. This project is archived and not under active development.

## How to use

You'll need to [download python3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to use this.

Then, download `automatic.py` by going [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mninc/automatic-v2/master/automatic.py), right clicking and saving as a .py file in the directory you want it in.
Run the program in a command-line interface.

The program will guide you through all the steps you need. It will also update itself (after asking you) when the time comes.
**One important thing to note is that elevated access to the backpack.tf apis is necessary to use this program.**

You can use the `help` command to see all the commands you can use.

This program is confirmed to work on all operating systems - if you have an issue it most likely isn't because of this.

Feel free to submit an issue or a pull request.

## Windows note
If the program opens and shuts when you run it, try downloading [Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48159).

## Note on logging
A detailed log is kept at `automatic.log`.

## OSX notes
After installing python you may need to run `/Applications/Python\ 3.6/Install\ Certificates.command` if an error occurs.

## Note on encrypting and decrypting files from before 23/12/2017 (12/23/2017)
On this date the method of encrypting and decrypting files was changed. Users with encrypted files from before this date should save [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mninc/automatic-v2/master/tools/decrypt.py) program into the same directory as `automatic.py` and run it.
Users then wanting to encrypt their file with the new method should save [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mninc/automatic-v2/master/tools/encrypt.py) program into the same directory and run it.

## TODO list
* Get confirmation there are no more bugs (there probably are)
* Build package for distribution that doesn't require a python installation - this is going to be done when there are definitely no more issues with this at all. The auto-updater will most likely have to be removed at this point, making it impossible to push smaller updates for bugs.

### TODO list history
* Make generic unusual buy orders work - Completed
